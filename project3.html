  <h2>Build an app</h2>
  <p> The third project in our Multimediadesign career was to come up with a design and a prototype for my own app.<br>
    <br>
    This was a very interesting project. We had to chose a theme for the app, Weather app, Listings App or a Sportstracking app. I chose the Weather app theme and specified it to outdoor people, especially for people who love to go fishing. So I designed a layout and a colour scheme for the app. I also made all the icons in the app and I am very pleased with the final result.<br>

  <h2>Enhancement of the app</h2>
  <p> Below you can see the new version of the Build an app project.<br>
    <br>
    The assignement was to improve the project, with the knowledge and skills I have accuired since I first made this project, to improve on functionality and/or design. This could also be based on the feedback from the original project<br>
    <br>
	This improved version has only minor changes, as the feedback was very positive. The changes that have been made are that the menu functionality has been greatly improved and can be reached from wherever within the app. This was not possible in the original project.<br><br>

  <h2>Reflection of learnings</h2>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I have learned</h4>
    This project had me venturing down the graphic design route. I learned very much, for example how to make icons, how to design specifically for smartphones and tablets and I also learned about the thought process behind a layout and colours.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I expected to learn</h4>
    What I learned in this process was exactly what I expected. I had an expectation for me to learn about graphic design, visual tools and methods and development methods, along with user tests. I am very pleased with both the finished product and learnings in this project.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What more do I need to learn</h4>
    One can always learn more and I try to learn as much as possible about different designs and processes, because that particular subject is very exciting and interresting.</section>
