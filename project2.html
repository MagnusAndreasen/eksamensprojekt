  <h2>Build your portfolio</h2>
  <p>The second project this semester was to take the design from the first project and make a website out of it. My very own portfolio website.<br>
    <br>
    It was now time to learn how to take a design and use it as a mock-up and to do our best to make our website to look like the design as much as possible. This was very difficult, I thought, and I was not at all pleased with the result.<br>

  <h2>Re-design</h2>
  <p> Below you can see a re-design of the Build your portfolio project.<br>
    <br>
    The assignement for this re-design, was to use the knowledge and skills I have accuired since I first made this project, to improve on functionality and/or design.<br>

  <h2>Reflection of learnings</h2>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I have learned</h4>
    With this project I struggled to learn HTML and CSS languages and as a result of that, my end product was very dissapointing. Nevertheless, I got basic hands on knowledge about programming and improved considerably, considering I wasn't very good at the start of this project.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I expected to learn</h4>
    I expected to learn the coding languages quicker and to be better at implementing the design to the website. This wasn't the case and I had to adapt my expectations to what I actually was able to do with the website.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What more do I need to learn</h4>
    During this project I realised that this coding stuff doesn't come easy and you have to work for it to be good at it. So the languages have to be relentlessly trained as often as possible. And that is what I have to do to be as good as I want to be.</section>
