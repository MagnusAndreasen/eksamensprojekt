  <h2>1. Semester exam project</h2>
  <p> The first project in our Multimediadesign career was to come up with a design for our own portfolio website.<br>
    <br>
    For some of us, this was the first time we ventured in to the area of web design. There were a lot of factors that had to be thought through, but in the end I was quite pleased with my design<br>

  <p> Below you can see a re-design of the Dream your portfolio project.<br>
    <br>
    The assignement for this re-design, was to use the knowledge and skills I have accuired since the first project, to improve on functionality and/or design.<br>

  <h2>Reflection of learnings</h2>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I have learned</h4>
    During this semester I have improved considerably in my skills and know-how about web design and graphic design.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What I expected to learn</h4>
    I didn't really have any expectations for what I thought we would learn during this first project, because I didn't have a clue about web design.</section>
  <section class="reflection">
    <h4>What more do I need to learn</h4>
    I still need to learn quite a few things about designing, like creating a concept out of nothing and sticking to that concept throughout the creative process.</section>
